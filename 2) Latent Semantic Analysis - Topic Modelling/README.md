# Topic Modeling with Latent Semantic Analysis:
## Abstract 
Developing the ability to understand the meaning of words and
passages is requisite for communication. This project aims to demonstrate the
same ability to classify text on the basis of context and topic through a
computational, statistical approach called Latent Semantic Analysis. LSA is a
theory and method for extracting and representing the meaning of words by
employing a mathematical technique called Singular Value
Decomposition(SVD). The documents are parsed and a matrix is built with the
number of rows equal to the number of distinct words, and the number of
columns equal to the document count. The corresponding matrix cell is
incremented for each word,document pair. Since the generated matrix is sparse
in nature, it is reconstructed using Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) by
finding a reduced dimensional representation, emphasizing on the strongest
relationship and eliminating the ‘noise’ involved.
